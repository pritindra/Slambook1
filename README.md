# Slambook1

In this era of global pandemic, lockdown made us into different human beings. Be it working from home or less interaction with friends and family. We students pursuing our studies in schools or colleges, sophomore or the final year students, always wanted to maintain a slambook of ourselves, where every batchmate could write thier views and how they feel. But everything being online now we thought of the same approach to a online slambook. It is as simple but effective to those feelings we get during our farewell and wanted to keep some memories.
